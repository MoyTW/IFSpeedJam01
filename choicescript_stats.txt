[b]Inventory:[/b]
*line_break
• Phone: Your phone, which you're prone to dropping. After your cracked the corner you encased it in a thick rubber protector.
*if inventory_has_backpack
  *line_break
  • Backpack: Your trusty backpack. You've had it since high school.
*if inventory_has_book
  *line_break
  • The Witch: A History of Fear, from Ancient Times to the Present by Ronald Hutton: A dense and scholarly but really informative book on the history of the witch figure, briefly covering modern and non-European contexts, but focusing mainly on medieval Europe. You haven't finished it yet but it's been amazing so far! It's entirely non-narrative, but that doesn't bother you in the least. The subject matter is really interesting, and the other book of his that you've read, Triumph of the Moon, was [i]incredible[/i], so you - well, look, you could go on and on about this, but you've got things to do. Anyways, you're looking forward to finding some time to devour the rest of it.
*if inventory_has_paperwork
  *line_break
  • Paperwork: A bunch of printouts and stuff that you have to bring to the student center. Why they won't let you email it and e-sign you have no idea.

  *line_break
  • Scavenger Hunt Sheet: A sheet with rules for the scavenger hunt, and a list of clues.
*if inventory_has_backpack

[b]Welcome to the University of the Midwest incoming student scavenger hunt![/b]
    
This fun exercise is an opportunity for incoming students to familiarize themselves with the various campus buildings and also win fabulous prizes! Here's how it will work.

Enclosed in the scavenger hunt pack this rules and hints sheet, a campus map, and a pack of proof stickers with your student number on them. Use the hints sheet and the campus map to find the hinted locations, and then simply place a proof sticker at the location. At the end of the day, our judges will come around and count the proof stickers, and the students with the highest scores will be entered into a raffle!

The contest ends on August 15. Scoring will occur at 8:30pm and the raffle will take place in the student center at 9pm, so make sure to show up promptly!

The top 3 prizes are as follows:
*line_break
1. A Cadillac El Dorado!
*line_break
2. A set of steak knives!
*line_break
3. You're fired!

I'm sorry, let me apologize. Sales got ahold of the computer for a moment, and went a little wild.

The real prizes are as follows:
*line_break
1. A signed copy of Dr. Mishima's book, [i]Teaching Without Regrets[/i], and a full credit for the university bookstore for all your course books for the year!
*line_break
2. A $150 dollars credit towards any university service you want!
*line_break
3. A $50 dollars credit towards the university shop!

Good luck! We hope you have fun!
