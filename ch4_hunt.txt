TODO: Time skip to breakfast, mid-conversation. You all look over the clues. You plan the time - you'll come back for lunch at 1pm, have dinner at 6pm, and finish at 8pm, which gives you a total of 8 hours.

TODO: If you took a late breakfast you lose an hour and only get 7 hours lol.

TODO: You talk about how you want to do the hunt.

"So, how do you want to do this, Morgan?"
