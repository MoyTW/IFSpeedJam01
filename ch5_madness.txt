You brace yourself for nausea or dizziness or some other waking nightmare, but nothing at all happens. Maybe expecting it to happen has somehow solved it? Maybe it was all in your head?

Carlo checks his watch. "All right," he says, "it's
*gosub_scene ch4_hunt func_print_time false
*if current_time <= 1800
  so we have some time before we said we'd get dinner."
  *goto spell_complete_continue
*else
  so how does dinner sound to you guys?"

"That works out," you say. "I'd like to go back to the dorms to get changed first, so can we stop by there for a bit?"

"Mouse?" he asks, looking over at her. She nods.

You put on a smile. "Thanks for coming," you say, looking between them.

"Yeah, I enjoyed it. It was a lot of fun." Carlo starts heading towards the exit. "I'm impressed with your problem-solving skills, Mouse."

"Yeah, Mouse," you say, "you did amazing!"

"Thanks," she says, tiling her face away. Aww, Mouse! You don't need to be so shy. It's fine if you are, though, don't worry, you're fine either way.

"So," asks Carlo, holding the exit open for the two of you, "what do you guys think they'll have for dinner?"

*fake_choice
  #Gremlin: "Pizza, pizza, pizza!"
  #Considerate: "Hard to tell, I bet the menu will be similar to yesterday. One vegetarian option, one meat dish, a bread or pasta option, and maybe a couple of wild card options?"
  #Nonplussed: "I couldn't say, we've only been here for two days. Not long enough to be familiar with their menus."

Carlo laughs. "Yeah, that's -"

Something invisible grabs both of your hands in an iron grip and pulls you through the door, and you stumble forwards, and something smashes you on the head, [i]hard,[/i] and you're falling backwards and you can see your hand, stretched out in the sunlight, and the nails are flying off, and then the skin sloughs off in a scaly rain to reveal the muscles underneath, and your muscles unravel, falling away, and behind them you can see bone and it's happening to your arm now and it's moving up your shoulder and your finger bones are falling and your neck is sloughing its skin and soon it will reach your face and your mind revolts at the thought and switches off.

*page_break

You're not sure how to describe how you feel right now. Relieved? Comfortable? Good? That doesn't quite seem to cover it. It's like the time when Mom got hit by a car, and you spent the week alternating between weeping, not sleeping, and praying fervently, and then one day she walked back through the door and you ran over to her and cried for what felt like hours, and then you went to sleep for almost a whole day, and you woke up to her holding you and stroking your hair. That's what you're feeling now. If there's a word for that, you don't know it.

You open your eyes. You're lying in what's pretty obviously the school's nursing area, or office, or whatever they call it. Oh, there's Mouse, playing on her phone. There's nobody else here. You sit up and look out the window. You've been out long enough for it to go from cloudless and sunny to heavily overcast, but not long enough for it to get dark.

Hmm. Where's Carlo? Well he's not your boyfriend or anything, it's completely reasonable for him to go do something else. It's not like he could help the doctors or anything.

"Hey, Mouse," you say.

Mouse jumps, her head snapping up, but her eyes still refusing to meet yours. She shoves her phone into her pocket. "Are you okay?" she asks, her voice at a surprisingly normal volume. She must be worried.

"I think so." It's hard to be sure, though.

*fake_choice
  #"How long was I out?"
    Mouse checks her phone. "Almost fifty minutes," she says. "You came to when you were brought into the medical center, but you fell asleep after that and slept for about thirty-five minutes."
  #"Can you tell me what happened?"
    "You collapsed. We called the campus hotline and they brought you here. You came to when you arrived, but feel asleep afterwards, so the doctor said to just let you sleep."
  #"What did the doctor say?"
    "He said you to let you sleep."

    "He what!?" you exclaim. That's negligence, isn't it?

    "You came to when you arrived," she says. "You were asking your mom to let you sleep longer. Then you fell asleep. The doctor said to just wait, so we did."

Well, you don't remember waking up, but it's possible. You look out the window again. Soâ€¦all of that was just sleep deprivation? That can't be right, can it? You definitely don't have narcolepsy or anything like that. "Thanks for looking out for me, Mouse." You turn back to her. "I appreciate it."

She makes an attempt at a smile, which is a little hard to watch. "Thank you," she says, again at a normal volume. Weird. "I'm going to go tell the doctor you're up."

"Sure," you say as Mouse stands up. "I'll just sit here for a bit, then." You pull out your phone. No calls, but a couple of texts from friends back home. You can take a look later.

"Hello!" You look up to see a man in vaguely medical clothes with a big nametag on. Joshua Graham, Nurse Practitioner. He has a clipboard and a pen in hand. "How are you feeling, ${player_first_name}?"

*fake_choice
  #Gremlin: "Wrong person. I don't know who that is, but that ain't me!"
    He pauses. "If ${player_first_name} is not your name, could you please give me your preferred name, then? First and last."
    
    "Morgan Faye," you say. "Sorry."
  #Considerate: "I'm sorry, I think there's been some sort of mistake. My name's Morgan, not ${player_first_name}."
    "No problem," he says, "can you give me your full name?"
    
    "Morgan Faye," you say.
  #Nonplussed: "Are you talking to me?"
    The nurse nods. "I am," he says.
    
    "I'm sorry," you say, "my name's Morgan Faye. And I'm feeling fine, thank you."

He nods, crossing something out on his clipboard. "Now, Morgan, can you tell me where you are?"

"In the school's nursing office."

"That's right. Do you know what day it is?"

"The fifteenth of August." You pause, staring out the window at the frankly ominous clouds. It's going to be cold out, isn't it? Should've brought a jacket. "And it's getting late. I don't think I have a concussion or anything."

"Well," says Joshua, "concussions can be tricky, sometimes. Especially with the football players, those folks are sometimes pretty stubborn. I'd appreciate if you would humor me. Can you describe what happened and what you're doing here?"

*fake_choice
  #Gremlin: "Answering a who, what, where, when quiz about myself, except it's who where when what. Are you going to ask me why or how next?"
    Joshua smiles, but it's a little strained. "No that's the last of them," he says. "Can you give me your student ID card, so I can mark down your number for our records?"
  #Considerate: "Well, I apparently fainted, was brought to your office, and woke up. Then I then slept for an hour, and now you're evaluating me. Does that answer your question?"
    "It does," he says, "thank you for asking. Would you mind giving me your student ID card, so I can finish documenting this visit?"
  #Nonplussed: "I passed out, was brought here, and am now I answering a series of questions to evaluate my mental state."
    "That's all I need," he says. "Would you mind giving me your student ID card, so I can finish documenting this visit?"

"All right," you say, fetching your card out of your wallet. You're kind of regretting not taking more care with your picture, it's not the most - what the fuck? Why does it say ${player_full_name} on it?

What the fuck is this? It's a good thing your face is turned away from Joshua. It was Morgan Faye when you got it, you distinctly remember this, and you definitely had Morgan Faye on your paperwork. The card has the same picture. And it hasn't left your wallet. But it says you're ${player_full_name}. What should you tell him? Yes, that's my picture, but it's not my name? Somehow the name on my student ID card, the card that has the same name as the name I registered, the card that I've had on me for the whole time these last two days, somehow the card got replaced by a perfect forgery except that the name is wrong by, what, fucking magic? If this is a prank, it's a dumb fucking prank. Who the fuck would even want to do that, anyways?

Look, you can figure this out later, get out of here first. You obviously can't argue about it, he'll just think you're concussed or something.

"Here," you say, putting on the calmest fact you can and holding out the card.

"Hmm," he says, looking at the card, "that's definitely you, but the card does say ${player_full_name}."

*fake_choice
  *selectable_if (true = false) #Did I actually get concussed and I'm suffering from the thing where you say or hear something but you actually say or hear a completely different word, except that it's only happening to my name?
  *selectable_if (true = false) #This is the worst fucking day, between the weird dizziness and hallucinations and literally passing out and now this? If this does end up being a prank I will murder whoever did this.
  #"Sorry," you say, "my mother remarried and I wanted to get a name change. ${player_full_name} is correct, but I prefer to be called Morgan Faye."

"No problem," he says, copying something down onto his sheet. "Names are tricky things. A lot of people prefer to be called something other than what's on their documents. Sorry for the trouble. You're good to go, Morgan." He hands you back your ID. "I'd recommend that you take it easy and do all the boring healthy things that we usually recommend. Drink enough liquids, get enough sleep. If the start of the year is stressing you out, we do have on-site counseling available, which you book online. If you prefer talking to somebody directly to make an appointment, you should feel free to drop in by the front desk."

You put on a smile. "Thanks, I appreciate it." You grab your pack off the ground and stand up. "So, we can go now, right?"

"Sure can," he says, waving. "Y'all have a nice evening."

*page_break

You hustle into the clinic lounge, wrestling your pack onto your back. Mouse trails you as you step outside and - why is everything so neat and well-maintained? You've gone insane, haven't you? The path to the Admin Building is laid with neat, cleanly fitted tiles. Its walls are neatly painted and free of vegetation. Its windows are clean and nice. None of this was true on the way on! You stare, open-mouthed.

"Hey," says Mouse. You jump, and look over at her. She's worried, you can tell. "Do you, uh." She swallows. "Do you want me to call you Morgan?"

*choice
  #"Yes. Please."
    "Okay," she says, "I'll call you Morgan."
  #"Yes. If that's okay?"
    "Okay," she says, "I'll call you Morgan."
  #"I don't know."
    She's silent for a little while. "Would it make you feel better?"
    
    You shrug.
    
    "I'd like to call you Morgan," she says.

"Hey, Mouse, how did I introduce myself to you?"

She swallows. "${player_first_name}."

"Oh. This, this sounds weird, but when I say Morgan and ${player_full_name}, you hear different things, right?"

"Yes," she says. "They're different."

"Shit," you say. "Shit! Mouse, I don't remember doing that. I remember telling you that my name was Morgan. And that my student ID card had Morgan on it, andâ€¦and other things." What, you're going to tell her about how you passed out and that magically made the campus look neat? Yeah, that's not crazy person talk at all.

It's cold. It's not dark, but it's cold. In fact, it's freezing. How did you not notice this before? Either it's gone from warm and sunny to cloudy and freezing in an hour, or it really always was cloudy and freezing, and the walls of the buildings always were pristine, and your name always was ${player_first_name}. Are you crazy?

"Morgan," says Mouse, "do you want to go get dinner?"

It's a good question. It's about that time. You don't want to get dinner, though. You think of going to the cafeteria, all well-lit and swarming with a hundred hungry students, standing in line to get a sandwich or something. You want to either fix this or go to sleep and wake up in a sane world. What are you doing, Morgan? Disgraceful. Gone from calm to panicked in the space of five minutes. Have some fucking composure, Morgan. Control yourself! Sure, you've either gone crazy or been transported into another dimension or something. That's no call to fall apart like this.

"Hey," says Mouse, "Morgan, do you want to go to my room? I can get you dinner."

"Okay," you say.

Well, that's it. Can't argue with all that. Everything, everybody says I'm ${player_full_name}.

I guess I've gone crazy. No other explanation.

*page_break

The door opens. Mouse comes in. She puts the takeout boxes on the desk.

"Are you okay, Morgan?"

*fake_choice
  #"Yes."
  #"No."
  #"I don't know."

Mouse waits. Then she says, "Do you want to eat?"

*fake_choice
  #"Yes."
  #"No."
  #"I don't know."

Mouse watches you. "You - you can sit here," she says. She pulls out the desk chair.

Mouse waits. "Morgan," she says, "should I call a doctor?"

*fake_choice
  #"No!"

She winces. You shouted? You shouted. "No," you continue, more quietly, "I'm fine. I don't want to see a doctor. I'm fine."

She swallows. "Okay," she says. "Can you tell me what's going on?"

"No offense," you say, "but I just met you, like, yesterday, Mouse. You barely know me."

Mouse takes a long time to respond. "Then what do you have to lose?"

"What?"

"You barely know me, right? Why shouldn't you tell me?"

Because some things are fucking private, Mouse? Just because everybody shits doesn't mean they want somebody staring at them in the bathroom? Because I'm going crazy and I'm apparently delusional and I have some fucking pride and I don't want you to see me exploding into a million pieces? Because even though I've just met you I still want to be your friend and I don't want you to think I'm fucking insane? Because if I tell you then I'm going to have to admit that everything in the world is insisting that I'm not who I think I am? Because if I admit this is happening, that every single fucking memory I have is false, then what else is false?

Goddammit, now I'm just crying and mumble-shouting incoherently on the bed of some random girl who I just met a day ago. What the fuck is this, Morgan?

*page_break

You run out of energy eventually. You lie on Mouse's bed, not quite sleeping. You're not sure how long.

"Hey Morgan?" She waits for you to look over at her before she continues. "Can you tell me what you want me to do?"

Sorry. I'd tell you if I knew, Mouse. I'm sorry for causing such a scene, too, and for messing up your bed and getting it all covered in sweat and tears. Thank you for being so sweet, but I don't want to be too much trouble. I think it'd be best if I just went to my room and slept. You shouldn't trouble yourself with me. I'll figure this out, somehow.

You sit up and look over at her. She's on edge. Of course she is. You - you didn't have to do any of this, Mouse. You could've just dropped me off at the nurse and asked them to call you when I got out, you didn't have to play mom to me, but I'm deeply grateful that you did. Oh. I'm smiling, now, aren't I? I hope it doesn't look too creepy, I'm sure I look like a mess. "Mouse," you say, "I'm sorry. Thank you for helping me. Right now, I'd like to go back to my room and sleep. If you'd still like to talk tomorrow, I'll tell you about it then. Is that okay?"

"Yes," she says. "Morgan," she adds as you stand up, "thank you for trusting me."

Mouse, we just met. It's no big deal. But, thanks.

[b]Ending B: Life Goes On[/b]

The two of you never did figure out what happened.

It turns out that Mouse had seen the campus as clean and shiny the whole time. You surreptitiously corroborated that with some other students and discover that the crumbling campus had been a wholesale hallucination. You went back and talked to Alex about it, and he had no recollection of ever having a bad word to say about its physical appearance.

You end up just putting it down to the fickleness of memory. What else could you do?

As for your nameâ€¦

*fake_choice
  #I learned to live with it.
    You dream of yourself as Morgan, but you use ${player_first_name}. You thought about getting a name change, but it seemed like a lot of trouble, and you didn't mind your new name so much.
    
    Well, you say new, but by all evidence, it was the only name you'd ever had.
  #I changed my name to Morgan Faye.
    It was a lot of trouble, changing your name. Your family and friends were all quite confused, and you took to joking that took it in honor of Morgan le Fey, since you already had a reputation for being into medieval history. At first they thought you had gone a little 'off' but it all ended up sorting itself out. More annoying was getting the name registered with all the necessary organizations.

And so, life went on. You graduated on time. You made friends, went to parties, studied reasonably hard, and at the end, you walked out and took your diploma with all the rest of your classmates.

You never figured out what happened, but in the end, it didn't much matter.

Maybe that's a lie. It's hard to tell with these things. You'll certainly never forget it. Also, you don't know if you would be nearly as close to Mouse if you hadn't had that experience. So there's at least one thing you can thank those strange couple of days for.

In the end, though, life went on.
