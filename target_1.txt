You look at the clues sheet. "Well, it just straight-up says it's in the admin building. So, let's get moving."

The three of you traipse over the admin building, a gigantic two-story building with overgrown walls, and enter the main lobby.

*gosub target_1_room_description

You all sit around one of the empty coffee tables to discuss the clue.

"So, it says it's in the lobby," you say, "but the only other clue is September 19, 2021. And today's August 15, 2021."

Mouse blinks. "I know it," she says.

"Really?" asks Carlo. "Well, don't tell me yet." He looks about for a few seconds, leafs through a couple of magazine covers, then nods. "I have a guess," he says.
*if puzzle_share_immediately
  "I bet we're expected to flip the calendar to September and put it on the 19th."
  
  Mouse nods. "Yes," she says.

    You go over to the calendar and flip forward a couple of months. Apparently, September 19 is International Talk Like a Pirate Day, which you haven't really heard of. You quickly look it up on your phone and apparently that's a real thing.
    
    Well, okay then.

    The three of you make a tour of the paintings. There's a painting of a tractor and wheat, a painting of some very nice-looking lakes, a painting of a big 1600s sailing ship identified by the plaque as the Mayflower, a painting of a Civil War soldiers at, apparently, Gettysburg…nothing that screams September 19th, and definitely nothing that screams 2021.
    
    Well, maybe the tractor one could be set in 2021, or the lakes one, but they're dated 2016 and 2016, respectively. Actually, all the paintings are 2016. Did they get a new building in 2016 or something? Not that that matters.

    "Right," says Carlo, "but that's impossible. It's in the future."

    "No," says Mouse.

    You look at mouse. "Did you mean, no, it's not possible, or no, it's not impossible?"

    "It's a scavenger hunt," she says. You strain to hear her. "They might make a fake magazine."

    Carlo opens his mouth like he wants to say something, shuts it, and then chuckles. "Well, you have a point. Okay," he says, pawing through the magazines again, "let's check them all?"
    
    It turns out that, no, none of the magazines have a future release date, or show any signs of either fabrication or time travel. It was a good idea though, right?

The lobby feels a little like a doctor's office waiting room, with neat white walls and a plethora of waiting chairs, about a quarter of which are filled with parents and, more rarely, students. In the center is a large glass coffee table with magazines scattered all about, and a high desk with a receptionist currently attending to an anxious pair of middle-aged men. Around the walls they've put little tables with flower pots, and on the walls are various paintings of idealized midwestern farmers. Near the door is hung a gigantic wall calendar with school events marked out in neat sharpie.
