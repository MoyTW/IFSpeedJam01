You read the clue out loud. "Which dorm has the strongest association with Saul?"

"Saul?" asks Carlo. "Like, Bob Odenkirk?"

"Sorry, who?"

"The actor who pays Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul." Carlo grins. "Good shows, by the way. You ever seen them?"

*choice
  #Gremlin: "Isn't Breaking Bad really old? Do you only watch old shows and movies, Carlo, or have you watched anything made in the last ten years?"
    "Ah," says Carlo, "actually, Breaking Bad ended in 2013. You should always double-check your barbs before you throw them."
    
    "Really? You memorize the year dates for the old shows you watch?"
    
    "You can't hold my amazing memory against me. And you keep calling it old. Morgan, 8 years isn't that old. My grandfather is still going at strong 97. It only seems old because you're so young."
    
    You can see Mouse struggling to suppress a grin. "Gah," you say, "they're right, Boomer really is a state of mind."
    
    Mouse breaks out in a fit of laughter as Carlo places a hand on his heart. "I am wise beyond my years," he intones.
    
    "Okay but seriously," you say, "I don't think it's the guy from Breaking Bad."
    
    "Yeah," he says, "you're probably right."
    
    After her giggles subside,
    *goto mouse_unfolds_her_map
  #Considerate: "I haven't. I don't watch many of the older shows, but I hear that they're regarded highly."
    "They're very good," he says. Then he pauses. "That's probably not what they're going for in this scavenger hunt."
    
    You shrug. "Either way's possible, but I've never seen it. Does it seem like it'd be relevant to any of the dorms?"
    
    "No," he says, "not at all."
    
    *goto mouse_unfolds_her_map
  #Nonplussed: "No. Still, I don't think they would make a pop-culture reference to a show that's out of our age range."
    "You're probably right." He unfolds his map and scans the dorm names. "You're definitely right," he says.
    
    *goto mouse_unfolds_her_map

Mouse unfolds her map, nods, and starts typing into her phone. Well, she's clearly got ideas. On the other hand, Carlo looks pretty stumped. You stare at your own map. Monty Hall, Basket Hall, Hall of the Americas, Hall the Apostleâ€¦who named these dorms? These can't be real names. Well, Monty Hall and Basket Hall could be, but the others?

*if puzzle_share_immediately
  "Hall the Apostle," declares Mouse.
  
  "Wait," you say, "are you talking about Paul the Apostle?"
  
  "He was also called Saul," she clarifies. "I looked it up."
  
  You look over at Carlo. He shrugs. "I don't even know who Paul the Apostle is. My parents weren't religious."
  
  Really, Carlo? Even if you're not religious, how can you not at least have heard to Paul the Apostle? That seems impossible! Surely some people you know are religious, right? Though he is from San Francisco. Maybe that's just how it is there.
  
  You quickly search Saul The Apostle on your phone and, yes, Mouse is right. "Nice job," you say, grinning, "I think that's it."
  *goto destination_choice
*else
  "I know," declares Mouse.
  
  Too fast! How does she do it?
  
  "I'm drawing a blank," says Carlo, shaking his head. "I think I might have watched too much TV to get this one. Can't think of any Sauls other than Goodman."
  
  You frown. "I thought it was Odenkirk?"
  
  "No, Odenkirk's the actor, the name of the character is Saul Goodman."
  
  You shrug. Yeah, that isn't it. Okay, so, what is?

  "It's Hall the Apostle," says Mouse, almost too quiet to hear.
  
  You look over at her and put on an encouraging smile. "Sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you get, Mouse?"

You trek up to room 310, but there aren't any paintings here. Instead, they've decorated the walls by hanging intricately patterned Tajik rugs. Wait, what? Holy shit! They look like Grandma's! They're beautiful! Who decides on the decorations? Is there somebody from Central Asia working here?

"Nah," says Carlo in disappointment, "this isn't it."

But look at the rugs, Carlo! No, he's not looking at the rugs. Mouse doesn't seem particularly interested, either. Well, you can't blame them. You'll have to come back up here later, but for now, time to go. "Okay," you say, "wasn't this one."

Why are all these buildings' exteriors so badly maintained, anyways? No use worry about it now, but at some point you've got to go ask somebody, maybe a teacher or something. Or are they professors now?

Look, that's not important. What's important is the fact that ${target_hall} also doesn't have any paintings on the third floor, instead sporting movie posters for Marvel movies. "Who picks the decor in these halls?" you ask, staring at a poster of The Batman.

"It's the RAs I think," says Carlo.

Well, that explains a lot. "Wrong twice," you say. "It's a coinflip now."

To your disappointment, ${target_hall} is not the correct hall. The RA has chosen strings of lights, and there's not a picture to be seen. That's three for three wrong.

The three of you tramp over to Hall the Apostle. It, like all the other dorms, is crumbling and overgrown, and like all the other dorms its floor plan is identical to Monty Hall's. You take the elevator up to the third floor and walk over to room 310. Sure enough, the hallway is decorated in various paintings.

"Right," you say, "the clue says it's behind 'the painting most related to Saul's dramatic escape.'" You glance down the hallway. There are five paintings, or rather, prints of paintings, all on the wall opposite the windows. You take a slow walk down the corridor.

The first one is some sort of Native American pyramid with stepped walls, all overgrown with vines, surrounded by a verdant jungle. Honestly, it's kind of like how the dorms look from the outside.

The second is a vaguely Renaissance-ish painting of an idealized farmhand or maid or something similar, carrying a gigantic wicker basket of laundry. She's not wearing any shoes, she's incredibly clean, and in general it all just looks like it was painted during that phase when all those rich Europeans were going gaga over rural life. Come on, old rich painting-commissioning Europeans. That's now how somebody who actually works would look. At least give the poor girl some shoes!

Anyways, the third one is of a modern city! Actually, most of it is of a very long red suspension bridge, but the city in the background has some skyscrapers in it. The day is clear, and the bridge is full of very detailed cars, but it's pretty unremarkable otherwise. For what it's worth, the water's very pretty.

The fourth is a very dignified man in a study in late 1800s formalwear, bent over a fancy desk. On it is a sheet of paper, and in his hand is a quill. He has a top hat next to him, but he's not Abraham Lincoln. Not to say that only Abraham Lincoln wore a top hat, of course. If this is supposed to be a famous person, you have no idea who it is.

The last is a old-timey paddle ship on a river. What are they called? Steam boats? There are well-dressed ladies and gentlemen on the deck, and the riversides are awash in green.

"Well," says Carlo, looking over the hangings, "none of these seem particularly dramatic or escape-y to me."

Mouse puts down her phone. Has she been searching something again? "I know," she says.

Well, at this point, it'd be more shocking if Mouse didn't figure it out.

You look over to Mouse and raise an eyebrow.
  
"It's the laundry basket."

Laundry basket? Paul, laundry basket, Paul, escape, Paulâ€¦come on, did all that Bible Study just fall right out of your head, Morgan? What dramatic escapes did Paul have? Nope. Drawing a blank. Apparently it did all fall out of your head. Too bad the hint wasn't about the Song of Solomon, you'd have gotten that one.

Think back, Morgan! Remember those days of Bible Study, where, well, it was nice, you got to see friends, but the teaching methods were kind of dull. Something more engaging would probably have been better. The content was interesting, but the presentationâ€¦not.

    She consults her phone. "He escaped from Damascus by being lowered in a basket."

    Shit, yes, of course, how did you forget that, other then the fact that it's hardly ever come up and you can barely remember it in the first place? Were you just meant to Google everything for this one? Well it worked for Mouse.

Mouse looks at the painting of ${proposed_painting}, then back at you, then back at the farmhand. "Okay," she says.

Mouse, does that mean okay, I see it, or does that mean, okay, I disagree, but I'm too shy and conflict averse to actually contradict you? Speak up, Mouse! Explain your intentionally ambiguous statements! 

It's definitely the second one, though, and as much as you'd like her to speak up hounding her would only hurt. You put on a bright smile. "Okay," you say.
