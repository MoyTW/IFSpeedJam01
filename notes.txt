Speed Jam #1: Student Center
• You are a first year student approaching the student center at a rural university.
• A trail through a narrow strip of trees and shrub leads north to a parking lot.
• The Admin Building is to the west via a path that winds around a pond.
• A cluster of science labs is to the east.

Summary

You're a student who's seemingly doing mundane first day of school activities, but everything about the university and yourself is horribly wrong. Nobody comments on this, least of all you.

Your objective is to stick some stickers your brother gave you onto specific spots around campus as part of a scavenger hunt.

It turns out that you're actually a soul bound to a witch's body that she was using to safely access the university buildings (they were cursed) and once you place the last sticker she forcibly seals off the school, returning you to your proper reality.

[b]Writing Notes[/b]

You have 3 general tones:
1) Gremlin
2) Considerate
3) Nonplussed

[b]Sticker Progression[/b]
1) Carlo calls you [your name].
2) You get really dizzy and your sense of proprioception suddenly gets really off, but only Mouse notices. It returns instantly.
3) You're suddenly filled with a feeling of tension, like you're struggling to lift something, except you aren't. Obviously.
4) You have a body horror moment, but no time passes. When you come back to reality, Carlo and Mouse think you're having a panic attack or something.
5) The world splits in two. You pass out, and wake up in the health services wing in the admin building. Everybody calls you [your name].
