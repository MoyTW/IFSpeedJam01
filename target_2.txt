You look at the paper. "Let's look at the clues for number two."

Carlo nods. "Can you read it for the class?"

"Of the three northernmost buildings, which has the least to do with bread?" You grin. "Well, we've got a one in three chance."

Mouse unfolds her map and gives it a cursory glance. @{puzzle_share_immediately "Smith Center," she says. | "I know," she says. }

  "The ${target_center}?" Carlo frowns. "You sure? I think it's the Smith Center." He looks over to Mouse.

The three of you walk over to the ${target_center}, a two-story rectangular building of crumbling concrete. You swipe yourselves in and set to searching for the kitchen, but it soon becomes apparent that there isn't one. There's a break roof with a refrigerator and a coffee machine, but there's not even a microwave or hot plate.

Unless they clue sheet has an extremely generous definition of kitchen, you're in the wrong building. You check your phone. You've lost about half an hour.

The Smith Center is much like the others, a crumbling concrete edifice studded with grimy windows, but it's significantly taller at four stories. The three of you pass through the main entrance to find yourself in a large, well-lit lobby. Half of the lobby which seems sectioned off into a dining area, and the other half has benches between giant plant pots.

"Ah," says Carlo, pointing towards the dining area, "there's the kitchen." Sure enough, there's a door with a window in it with a sign above it, proclaiming it the kitchen. The three of you pile in.

*page_break

The kitchen is a rectangular room, wide enough to comfortably fit four people side by side and quite long. Near the door they've put all the lightweight stuff, toasters, coffee machines, a couple of microwaves, and a large notice board up on the wall. Further back there's a big refrigerator with an oversized freezer, a couple of sinks, a four-burner oven stove under a fume hood, and plenty of counter space.

Plenty is an understatement, actually. There's a huge amount of counter space, and a towel rack stocked with clean towels, and a really excessive amount of spatulas in this drawer, and holy shit, there's like three different brands of food processor in this cabinet, what? But why different brands? And this next one has a pair of stand mixers. Is this for students, or do the keep a cook on hanging around? It can't be, can it, everything's so clean! Or maybe the students who use it bring their own stuff and just leave it here? But if that were true wouldn't it be full of random junk? And that stove doesn't look like a commercial model, either. But everything's so nice!

*fake_choice
  #Holy shit, this kitchen is so nice, do they let us use this? I would use this. I would use the hell out of this. Do you need to reserve it, or can you just walk in?
    "Damm," you say, "this is way nicer than the kitchen at home. Do they let the students use this? I would use this. Absolutely, one hundred percent, I would use this."

    Carlo studies the postings on the notice board. "It looks like they do let the students use it, but they ask that you clean up after yourself."

    "Nice, I'm going to use the hell out of this," you say, ruffling through the drawers and pulling inspecting their impressive array of knives. "Guys, I might seem too excited, but honestly? I think I'm not excited enough!"

    Mouse clears her throat, and you pause. "The dorms have a kitchen."

    You grin at her. "You'll have to show me when we're done, then."

    "Yeah," laughs Carlos, "after we do the hunt."

    "Right. The hunt. Uh." You set the clue sheet on one of the counters. "Okay, so, this one's some kind of code."
  #Who cleans this? That's a lot of cleaning. Is there a dishwasher, or - oh, there's a dishwasher under the sink. Do they have the janitors clean it out or is that only for utensils and such?
    "Who do you think cleans this?" you ask, checking the contents of various cabinets. There's big pots, small pots, pans of all different sizes, this cabinet is apparently woks, whoa, didn't expect that.
    
    "Students, I think," says Carlo, studying the notice board. "No, there's a janitor, too. It asks you to clean up after yourself but it also says that the janitor will run the washing machine every night."
    
    "So students can use this?" you ask. Hey, they've got sous vide bags in here. They must have a vacuum sealer you haven't found. "Do you need to sign up? Or can you just walk in?"
    
    "Not sure," he says. "Not to rain on your parade, Morgan, but we should probably take a look at the clues."
    
    "Right. The hunt. Uh." You close the cabinet you were inspecting and set the clue sheet on one of the counters. "But it's real cool that they let students use it."
    
    Carlos gazes at you with a slight expression of amusement, and you sigh. "Fine," you say. "Clearly neither of you are very excited by this kitchen. Anyways, this one's some kind of code."
  #This is super impressive, and I'll have to check it out later, but I should really get back to the scavenger hunt.
    Focus, Morgan! The kitchen will exist tomorrow! The world still turns! Today, you've a scavenger hunt to do.
    
    Right!
    
    You pull out the clue sheet and lay it out next to one of the toasters. "So," you say, "this one's some sort of code."

You stare at the letters, contemplating how best to solve it.

Mouse pulls out her phone and fiddles with it. Carlos bends over and looks at it for a few seconds, then says "Hey, Morgan, do you have spare paper in your pack?"

"Sure," you say, pulling out your welcome packet. You find a page that's clean on one side and rip it out. "Give it back," you say, proferring a pencil alongside it.

"Right. It's a cipher of some sort,"  he says, copying the clue. "I bet I can get it pretty quick."

Mouse puts down her phone. "I got it," she says.

Fast! Mouse, what the heck, in the amount of time it took Carlo to copy it over, you've already solved it? Mouse, you're a little scary! But I'll get it, too.
